            <p>
              Full-Stack AI/ML Engineer with experience building and deploying production-grade AI systems across cloud platforms (AWS, SageMaker), ML infrastructure (Docker, LangChain, Temporal), and modern frontends (React, Angular, Vue3).
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently based in New York (by way of Pune, India), I specialize in LLM orchestration, RAG pipelines, and Explainable AI—with successful deployments in academic, startup, and nonprofit environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              I thrive where code meets creativity: I've architected a 3M+ SKU attribute extraction pipeline, built PhD alumni dashboards processing 20K+ records, and developed virtual try-on systems that achieved 91% user preference in studies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether it's wrangling large language models, engineering hybrid normalization frameworks combining semantic embeddings with fuzzy matching, or building interactive dashboards that impress stakeholders, I believe technology should be as intelligent as it is accessible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some people collect stamps—I collect algorithms, side projects, and a running list of product ideas. From translating 4,000+ Bollywood scripts to optimizing urban health facility placement, I'm always looking for the next interesting problem to solve.
